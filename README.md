## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I feel like this app was especially hard because as I was putting the app together, there were many things I had to install and following the instructions got tougher as we went along. The instructions would list terms that I haven't previously heard before, and I would have to look them up and search what they are and since I didn't know what we could do with those things, following the instructions was tough. Not having previously installed pods either, I had many errors in trying to download it, and searching online for solutions took a long time as well, but no solution came out of it. I could manually put the movie information in but sending the information from one place to another was too difficult to do without pods.
